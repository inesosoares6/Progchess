# Progrchess

Progr(Ch)ess is a program to promote success that, combining programming and robotics and chess, explores countless benefits of the oldest board game, through attractive and innovative dynamics. Using a strong playful component, this project aims to be a contribution to the development of capacities associated with computational thinking and digital literacy, fostering transversal skills to the curriculum. The transferability of chess and programming and robotics allows not only to reinforce the domain of computing, but also also other domains of learning (e.g., reading, writing, mathematics, expressions, etc.). Thus, it is important to make learning more and more meaningful and contextualized, challenging students to develop multidisciplinary competences, reinforcing the confidence in your capabilities. The target audience for this project is elementary school students.
