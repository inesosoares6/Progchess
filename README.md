# Progr(Ch)ess

Progr(Ch)ess is a program to promote success that, combining programming, robotics, and chess, explores countless benefits of the oldest board game, through attractive and innovative dynamics. Using a strong playful component, this project aims to contribute to the development of capacities associated with computational thinking and digital literacy, fostering transversal skills in the curriculum. The transferability of chess, programming, and robotics allows not only to reinforce the domain of computing but also other domains of learning (e.g., reading, writing, mathematics, expressions, etc.). Thus, it is important to make learning more and more meaningful and contextualized, challenging students to develop multidisciplinary competencies, and reinforcing confidence in their capabilities. The target audience for this project is elementary school students.
